# PaypalNodeJS
A very simple implementation of the Paypal API in node JS. This will be branched to include a shopping cart and work as a serverless webstore

This is a very quick exercise to use the Paypal api at a very basic level.
I plan to extend on this to include a full shopping cart and subscription service for software.
